This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily missed, error in Expo's AsyncStorage. The bug showcases a scenario where attempting to access a non-existent key results in a null value that's not properly handled. This leads to a silent failure, potentially causing unexpected application behavior or crashes.  The solution demonstrates how to robustly check for null values before further processing, preventing this issue.
