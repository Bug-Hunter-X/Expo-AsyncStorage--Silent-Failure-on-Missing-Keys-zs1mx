This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo, specifically when you try to access a value that doesn't exist.  It's easily missed because AsyncStorage doesn't explicitly throw an error; instead, it silently returns `null`.  The problem arises when your code isn't handling this `null` value gracefully, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes further down the line.  For example, if you're trying to parse the retrieved value as a JSON object and it's `null`, you'll get a JSON parsing error.
